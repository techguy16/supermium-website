    <h2>What is Supermium?</h2>
	Supermium is a Chromium-based web browser. It is frequently updated, and developed to ensure compatibility with legacy operating systems.<br>
	You can learn more about Supermium <a href="../about/">here</a>.<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Where can I get it?</h2>
	You can get Supermium <a href="../">here from the website</a>, or you can download it from <a href="https://github.com/win32ssreleases">GitHub</a>.<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Who is Supermium developed by?</h2>
	Supermium is developed by win32. <a href="https://github.com/win32ss">Learn more about him and his other projects</a>.<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Why does Supermium get flagged by my antivirus software?</h2>
	Your antivirus software and/or browser may pick up the Supermium installer as malware. This is a false positive.<br>
	Supermium does not contain any malware, provided that you've installed it from the official website or GitHub.<br>
	<br>
	<h2>How come there are no Mac OS and Linux releases?</h2>
	At the moment, only Windows releases are made. Supermium was originally developed to have an up to date browser for older Windows operating systems.<br>
	The project has evolved since to being more than an updated browser for older Windows operating systems, however, currently Windows is still the priority release target and user audience.<br>
	Builds for Mac and Linux systems may be explored, but at this time there are no plans.<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Why is Supermium usually a few versions behind from the latest Chromium release?</h2>
	Rebasing Supermium to a newer version is a complex and time consuming process that requires many manual changes.<br>
	The browser is rebased to a newer version of Chromium every so often. This allows for a browser that is fairly up to date and secure to use.<br>
	In terms of security, being a few versions behind from the upstream release does not necessarily present any security risks.<br>
	Security patches for any major vulnerabilities are applied to Supermium and released as soon as possible, even if Supermium is not on the latest version.<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Why do some streaming services (Netflix, Spotify, etc) not work with Supermium?</h2>
	Many streaming services use a proprietary DRM by Google known as Widevine. Most Chromium forks like Supermium do not have signed Widevine.<br>
	As such some streaming services may give you an error when loading content. Supporting Widevine in Supermium would unfortunately be costly.<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Does Supermium automatically update when there is a new release?</h2>
	Currently Supermium does not automatically update. However, you can be notified of any new releases from the <a href="../rss/releases">RSS feed</a>, which you can add to your RSS reader.<br>

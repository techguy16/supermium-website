  <h2>About the Developer</h2>
  <p>I started creating modifications to Windows in December 2019 - the first was for Windows 2000 and allowed Word 2007 to read SHA-256 encrypted documents and Outlook 2007 to authenticate with modern e-mail servers.<br>
  <br>Then I started extending Windows Vista in June 2020. The moribund operating system was stuck with Firefox version 52 and Chrome version 49 for years, but was able to run Firefox version 115 and Chrome version 109 after my intervention. Even proper support for the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti was made available with driver modifications.<br>
  <br>However, as Google Chrome was preparing to drop support for Windows 7 and 8.x, it appeared that the old Vista-centric approach would no longer be sufficient. The product's user experience had also deteriorated in general, and competing web browsers did not adequately address these issues.<br>
  <br>As a result, in May 2023, the Supermium web browser was created. The initial focus was compatibility with Windows 7. Once compatibility was assured, the focus shifted to adding features unique to Supermium, such as look-and-feel options, as well as adding support for older operating systems such as Windows XP.<br>
  <br>In the end, economic pressures and societal trends contributed to a deterioration in mainstream software products in the past decade, with the process accelerating after western central banks increased interest rates against debt loads that did not exist when rates were previously at similar levels. The LSC is immune to these pressures and is willing to break the cycle of terminal decline in computer software. Without the debt, bureaucracy, or ideology that has permeated almost all major software projects, LSC can deliver performant software solutions with decades' worth of operating system compatibility.<br></p>
